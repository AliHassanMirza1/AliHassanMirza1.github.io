I am a Bachelor of Science (BS) – Computer Science (CS) student in my final year of undergraduate studies at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). My ambition is to build the next generation of mega-scale distributed and embedded systems that also strengthen and uplift underserved communities.

But if you ask me where that ambition truly sparked, I’d say it began in the flood-prone streets of Multan, in the underdeveloped southern Punjab. Growing up, I witnessed stark inequities—some communities prepared for natural disasters, while others were left powerless; some had reliable healthcare, while others struggled with even the basics. Seeing that divide shaped my sense of responsibility: I knew technology could help bridge those worlds.

At LUMS, every hands-on IoT field study, every blockchain-powered workflow, and every AI-driven healthcare project has reinforced my belief that well-designed, large-scale systems can uplift the very communities too often overlooked by progress. Now, as I approach graduation, I’m more determined than ever to unite my passion for distributed architectures with my drive to serve the underprivileged—by creating transformative solutions that level the playing field and empower people, no matter where they live.

## Misc

Besides my deep interest in large-scale distributed solutions, I **love gaming**—with **God of War** as one of my all-time favorites—and I’m an avid traveler. I’ve journeyed to some of the most remote, hard-to-access areas in northern Pakistan, including **Chuda Valley**. A major future goal of mine is to visit the **K2 base camp** and ultimately climb **Tiger Peak** (nicknamed “mini K2”).
